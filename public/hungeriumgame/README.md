# 3D Driving Game - Sound Implementation Guide

This document explains how to add realistic sound effects to the game.

## Sound Asset Structure

The game uses HTML5 Audio elements to play sounds. Sound files should be placed in the `assets/sounds/` directory:

```
assets/sounds/
├── engine.mp3       # Vehicle engine sound
├── siren.mp3        # Police siren sound
├── ambient_city.mp3 # Background city ambience (clear weather)
├── rain.mp3         # Rain weather sound
├── wind.mp3         # Wind/snow weather sound
├── collision.mp3    # Minor vehicle collision sound
├── crash.mp3        # Major vehicle crash sound
├── gunshot.mp3      # Weapon firing sound
├── missile.mp3      # Missile launch sound
├── background_music.mp3 # Game background music
```

## Recommended Sound Types

To achieve realistic sound effects, we recommend using the following types of sounds:

### Engine Sound
- A looping engine recording with a neutral RPM
- The game modifies playback rate based on engine RPM
- Length: 3-10 seconds (will be looped)
- Recommended format: MP3 or OGG, 128-192kbps

### Collision and Crash Sounds
- **collision.mp3**: Lighter impacts and bumps (metal/plastic bumping sounds)
- **crash.mp3**: Heavy, dramatic crash sounds for high-speed collisions
- Both should be short (1-3 seconds) with a strong initial impact
- Multiple variations can enhance realism

### Weather Sounds
- **rain.mp3**: Rain falling on vehicle/surroundings
- **wind.mp3**: Wind howling for snow weather
- **ambient_city.mp3**: City background noise for clear weather
- All should be ambient, looping sounds (10-30 seconds)

### Action Sounds
- **gunshot.mp3**: Quick, punchy weapon firing sound
- **missile.mp3**: Missile launch with whoosh effect
- Short, distinct sounds with good stereo effects

### Background Music
- Loopable track that suits driving game
- Should not be too distracting or overpowering
- Recommended length: 1-3 minutes (will be looped)
- Lower volume than other sound effects

## Implementation Details

The AudioManager class handles all sound loading and playback. Key features:

- Automatic loading of all sound assets
- Volume and playback rate adjustment for engine sounds based on speed
- Weather-dependent ambient sounds
- Crash sounds with volume based on collision intensity
- Automatic cleanup of audio resources

## Adding Custom Sounds

To add custom sounds:
1. Place high-quality MP3 files in the assets/sounds directory
2. Use the naming convention mentioned above
3. The game will automatically use your sound files at runtime

For the best experience, use high-quality sound recordings with good stereo separation.

## Sound Implementation Details

The game uses an AudioManager class that handles all sound playback:

- Sounds are loaded when the game starts
- Engine sound pitch changes based on vehicle speed
- Weather sounds automatically change with weather conditions
- Collision sound volume varies based on impact force
- Weapon sounds use slight variations in pitch and volume for realism
- Background music plays at a low volume to avoid being distracting

All audio implementation uses standard HTML5 Audio elements without dependencies on Web Audio API or external libraries for maximum compatibility.
